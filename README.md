UNO virtual game with C code

This game is implemented using simple C coding concepts including linked lists, arrays, input files, ASCII art designs, etc. It allows for multiple
players (2-10) to interact through the iostream to shuffle the deck of cards that are read in through an input file containing the cards' color and type.
Then the players are each dealt a hand of seven cards. All the original game rules of UNO are implemented, including "skip", "+2", "+4", "reverse", etc.
The players' hands are all printed each turn, and these hands are implemented using linked lists. The players are able to put a card down by typing in
the array index of that card in their hand.
